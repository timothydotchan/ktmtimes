News technical guidelines

https://support.google.com/news/answer/40796

Google News uses a computer algorithm to automatically crawl news sites. To help our system determine which webpages are actually articles, your site should follow our Technical Guidelines.

Here are some common technical issues you should consider:

Article URLs. To make sure we only crawl new articles, please make sure your URLs are unique with at least 3 digits, and are permanent.

Article Links. When our crawler scans your site, it looks for HTML links with anchor texts that includes at least a few words. We are also unable to crawl JavaScript, graphic links or links found in frames.

Article formatting. Our crawler is only able to include HTML articles. This means we cannot crawl PDFs or other non-HTML formats.

Robots.txt or metatags. In order for your content to be included in Google News, our user-agent must be able to crawl and index your site.

Multimedia content. We currently are unable to include audio files or multimedia content; however, we can sometimes crawl supplementary text on pages with this type of content and do include some videos from YouTube.

While not required, we highly recommend that you submit a Google News Sitemap through a Webmaster Tools account. Please note that you may receive errors if you submit your sitemap before your site has been reviewed and approved by our team.
