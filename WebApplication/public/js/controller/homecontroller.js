At a swinger's pool party in 1978, a flabby yet still somehow alluring Christian Bale gently grabs the arm of Sydney Prosser, played by Amy Adams at her most wide-eyed and guileful. Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet? he murmurs. The pair quickly retire to a private room, where Rosenfeld has a stereo at the ready; he drops the needle on Jeep's Blues, the pivotal Duke piece these made-for-each other lovers both love. The way they listen together is as intimate and quietly climactic as real sex.",
